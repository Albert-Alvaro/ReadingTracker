# CP1404 Assignment 2: Reading Tracker 2.0 by Albert Alvaro

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
This entire project took approximately 15 hours spread throughout 4 days
## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The sorting mechanic of the app was honestly the most satisfying thing for me to see
work properly, as that was the feature that probably took me the most time to make work.
The debugging process of the sorting feature took me 4 hours of looking and trying to find
what was making my program bug out, in the end it was all because I had forgotten to make it so that
the book title and author strings were using a .title() function.
## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am least satisfied with the necessitated use of a BookCollection class for this assignment, the Book class
proved to be incredibly useful, however the BookCollection class was just plain redundant and could more easily
be integrated directly into the main python file.
## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Thinking things through and trying to find a way to implement a feature to a program that already
has several interconnected features was essential in increasing my efficiency. Just trying to blindly
implement new code into a program that already has preexisting code might mean that I would have to modify
preexisting code to support the new code as well, I would have to think of a way that would not mess with the already
working features of the program. So thinking hard and long of a plan of action before actually coding is what worked
well for me during the entire coding process.
## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I feel as ig most of the problems I encountered could be solved easily by a higher levelled programmer who knows of more methods
and ways of doing what I was doing, significantly cutting down on the time needed to make said program. I feel like if ever comes a time where I
would need to do a project like this, I would try to do more research before doing any coding, as I had done little to no research
and had only looked something up when that something had become my wall during coding.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
The lecture files and W3Schools site as well as the docs.python.org site has contributed a lot to me being able to overcome this assignment.
Whenever I had come upon something I did not understand how to do, I would use the lecture files to try and find a way. If that does not work, I would
instead turn to W3Schools, and when that does not work I would look what confused me on docs.python.org. 

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenges I found were smoothly integrating the functions from BookCollection, Book, and main. I needed to harmonize all three
programs so that they could work together seamlessly, that in my opinion was my hardest challenge. I overcame this challenge by a combination of
planning ahead, trial and error, and looking through copious amounts of texts from docs.python.org, as more often than not, what I was looking for
can be found there.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
My experience with classes has been mostly positive, the Book class used for this project showed a large amount of usefulness,
I stand by what I said when I said that the BookCollection class is less than useful, to put it mildly.
